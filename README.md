# 🚀 About Me

I am a dedicated `full-stack developer` with a strong foundation in both `web` and `mobile` technologies. Leveraging a `Bachelor's degree in Computer Science` and at least `2` professional `years` of `experience`.

I specialize in creating robust, scalable solutions using `React.js`, `NextJS`, and `Flutter` for front-end development, coupled with `Express.js`, `Go`, `.NET` and `Python` for backend. My expertise extends to working with databases and cloud platforms, including `MongoDB`, `Supabase`, `Firebase`, `AWS` and `Azure`, as well as utilizing `Prisma` for `ORM` and `TensorFlow` for `machine learning` applications.

In addition to my primary focus on building user-centric web and mobile applications, I am also passionate about `game development`. I create games using `Unity`, `Flutter` and `Vanilla JavaScript` as a hobby, which enhances my problem-solving skills and creativity in software design.
