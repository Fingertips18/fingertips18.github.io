The study mainly focused on AI (artificial intelligence) and provided a unique mechanism for tracking the player's location based on their heart rate. The objectives of this study were to use the playerâ€™s heart rate as the heuristic value in the A* algorithm, implement an enemy-tracking mechanic based on the heart rate-based heuristics, and determine its accuracy against the default A* algorithm.",
